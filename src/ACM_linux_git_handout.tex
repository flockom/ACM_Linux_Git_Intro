\section{Introduction}
This tutorial will cover basic use of the bash shell and the git version control system.

  \subsection{Why Use the Shell?}

  \begin{verbatim}

<  It's A UNIX system!  >

        \   ^__^
         \  (OO)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\

  \subsection{Why use Version Control?}

\section{Some Prerequisite Material}

  \subsection{File System Layout}  
  The file system may be different than what you are used to (Micro\$oft). All files are organized into a single tree. Everything in Linux is a file (or a process). Directories are special files, your hard drive is a file, your speaker is a file, your screen is a file...etc. Disk partitions are \textit{mounted} into the tree however you find convenient as opposed to seeing them separately (C drive, D drive). The root of the tree is noted as `$/$'. The top level directories are those located at the root of the tree. They are fairly consistent across different *NIX operating systems and the different Linux distros. Here are some of the more common ones as described by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard Group~\cite{fhs}

  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    bin   & Essential command binaries         \\ \hline
    boot  & Static files of the boot loader    \\ \hline
    dev   & Device files                       \\ \hline
    etc   & Host-specific system configuration \\\hline
    home  & User home directories              \\\hline
    lib   & Essential shared libraries and kernel modules  \\\hline
    media & Mount point for removable media (flash drives/cdrom) \\\hline
    mnt   & Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily \\\hline
    opt   & Add-on application software packages   \\\hline
    proc  & Kernel and process information virtual filesystem  \\\hline
    sbin  & Essential system binaries \\\hline
    srv   & Data for services provided by this system  \\\hline
    tmp   & temporary files \\\hline
    usr   & Secondary hierarchy \\\hline
    var   & Variable data (/var/log contains log files)
  \end{tabular}

  \subsection{Users Groups and Permissions}
  Linux is a multi-user system. Every user has a username and a password. Additionally users can belong
  to groups. Every group can have multiple users and every user can belong to multiple groups. Users and 
  groups are the basic mechanism for managing access rights on a Linux system. 
  The file \texttt{/etc/passwd} contains a list of all users and maps usernames to IDs(uid)(among some other things). 
  The file \texttt{/etc/group} contains a list of all groups, maps from group names to gids and the users which have membership in them.

  Every file has associated with it an owner, a group and permissions. 
  The owner of a file is a user on the system. 
  Permissions consist of a list of access rights for the file which specify who
  can read/write/execute the file. These rights are specified for each file in relation to three categories of users: the owner, members of the file's group and everyone else. For example:
  
\begin{verbatim}
$ ls -l
total 152
-rw-rw---x 1 foo bars   1543 Nov  8 18:24 forkbomb
-rw-r--r-- 1 foo bars    206 Nov  8 18:09 ACM_linux_git_handout.tex
\end{verbatim}

  The file \texttt{forkbomb} can be read and written to by the user \texttt{foo} and members of the group \texttt{bars}. Everyone else is only allowed to execute the file. On the other hand the file \texttt{ACM\_linux\_git\_handout.tex} can be read and written by \texttt{foo} and only read by everyone else.
  
  
\section{The Shell}
Lets open up a shell and work with some basic commands.
  \subsection{Directory Navigation and File Manipulation}
  The most fundamental thing you need to be able to do is navigate the filesystem.
  First we should figure out where we are. 
  The command $pwd$ (print working directory) accomplishes this task.

\begin{verbatim}
$ pwd
/home/foo
\end{verbatim}

  We see that we are in home directory of the user \texttt{foo}.
