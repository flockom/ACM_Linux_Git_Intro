\section{Introduction}
This tutorial will cover basic use of the bash shell and the git version control system.

  \subsection{File System Layout}  
  The file system may be different than what you are used to (Micro\$oft). All files are organized into a single tree. Everything in Linux is a file (or a process). Directories are special files, your hard drive is a file, your speaker is a file, your screen is a file...etc. Disk partitions are \textit{mounted} into the tree however you find convenient as opposed to seeing them separately (C drive, D drive). The root of the tree is noted as `$/$'. The top level directories are those located at the root of the tree. They are fairly consistent across different *NIX operating systems and the different Linux distros. Here are some of the more common ones as described by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard Group~\cite{fhs}

  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    bin   & Essential command binaries         \\ \hline
    boot  & Static files of the boot loader    \\ \hline
    dev   & Device files                       \\ \hline
    etc   & Host-specific system configuration \\\hline
    home  & User home directories              \\\hline
    lib   & Essential shared libraries and kernel modules  \\\hline
    media & Mount point for removable media (flash drives/cdrom) \\\hline
    mnt   & Mount point for mounting a filesystem temporarily \\\hline
    opt   & Add-on application software packages   \\\hline
    proc  & Kernel and process information virtual filesystem  \\\hline
    sbin  & Essential system binaries \\\hline
    srv   & Data for services provided by this system  \\\hline
    tmp   & temporary files \\\hline
    usr   & Secondary hierarchy \\\hline
    var   & Variable data (/var/log contains log files)
  \end{tabular}

  \subsection{Users Groups and Permissions}
  Linux is a multi-user system. Every user has a username and a password. Additionally users can belong
  to groups. Every group can have multiple users and every user can belong to multiple groups. Users and 
  groups are the basic mechanism for managing access rights on a Linux system. 
  The file \texttt{/etc/passwd} contains a list of all users and maps usernames to IDs(uid)(among some other things). 
  The file \texttt{/etc/group} contains a list of all groups, maps from group names to gids and the users which have membership in them.

  Every file has associated with it an owner, a group and permissions. 
  The owner of a file is a user on the system. 
  Permissions consist of a list of access rights for the file which specify who
  can read/write/execute the file. These rights are specified for each file in relation to three categories of users: the owner, members of the file's group and everyone else. For example:
  
\begin{verbatim}
$ ls -l
total 152
-rw-rw---x 1 foo bars   1543 Nov  8 18:24 forkbomb
-rw-r--r-- 1 foo bars    206 Nov  8 18:09 ACM_linux_git_handout.tex
\end{verbatim}

  The file \texttt{forkbomb} can be read and written to by the user \texttt{foo} and members of the group \texttt{bars}. Everyone else is only allowed to execute the file. On the other hand the file \texttt{ACM\_linux\_git\_handout.tex} can be read and written by \texttt{foo} and only read by everyone else.
  
  
\section{The Shell}
Lets open up a shell and work with some basic commands.
  \subsection{Directory Navigation and File Manipulation}
  The most fundamental thing you need to be able to do is navigate the filesystem.
  First we should figure out where we are. 
  The command \texttt{pwd} (print/present working directory) accomplishes this task.

\begin{verbatim}
$ pwd
/home/foo
\end{verbatim}

  We see that we are in home directory of the user \texttt{foo}. The organization
  of users home directories in this way is just a convention, there's no magic (no `registry' either). 
  This is implemented using the \texttt{/etc/passwd} file on Linux. 

  For examples sake we need a file to work with. Lets create a file called foo.txt. We can use the following command to write into a file from standard input (your keyboard). Type the contents you would like to see in your file then hit the control key and D at the same time. $<$Ctrl$>$+D inserts a EOF (end of file) character into the terminal.

\begin{verbatim}
$ cat > foo.txt 
Just fooing around
\end{verbatim}

  Possibly the most used command is \texttt{ls}, which lists the contents of the working directory.
  
\begin{verbatim}
$ ls
foo.txt
\end{verbatim}
  
  Now we know that the directory \texttt{/home/foo} contains one file.
  If we want to copy a file we use the command \texttt{cp}

\begin{verbatim}
$ cp foo.txt bar.txt
\end{verbatim}

  Now there is a file called bar.txt which is a copy of foo.txt. One way to view a file
  is to use the \texttt{cat} command. cat takes file names, concatonates their contents and prints
  the result to standard output(your terminal).

\begin{verbatim}
$ cat foo.txt 
just fooing around
\end{verbatim}
  
  This is not always the best way to view a file, if it is really long you should use \texttt{less}.
  less will let you scroll through a file and only reads the file as you need it, so it can be faster than starting up a text editor.
  
  Instead of copying a file you might want to `cut' it. All you are really doing is \textit{moving} the file from one place to another, hence the command \texttt{mv}.
\begin{verbatim}
$ mv foo.txt baa.txt
\end{verbatim}

  Now the file foo.txt is called baa.txt. However, baa is rather unconventional\footnote{the correct name is baz} so we should delete it.
  Files can be removed using the \texttt{rm} command.

\begin{verbatim}
$ rm baa.txt
\end{verbatim}
  
  Careful! there is no magic trashcan(yet) once you rm a file it is gone for good.

  We pretty much have all the basics here but we have omitted one important detail, i.e. directories.
  Lets make a directory, this is done with the command \texttt{mkdir}

\begin{verbatim}
$ mkdir unconventional_metasyntactic_variable_names
\end{verbatim}
  
  Lets change into our new directory. Changing directories is done using \texttt{cd}.

\begin{verbatim}
$ cd unconventional_metasyntactic_variable_names
\end{verbatim}
  
  I hope you didn't write that all out. After typing \texttt{cd u} if you hit the <Tab> key bash
  will complete the name for you since it is the only file in the pwd which begins with a u.

  Here are some additional things you should know:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
      The file \texttt{\~} refers to your home directory. (its the same as writing \texttt{/home/foo})
    \item 
      The file \texttt{.} refers to your pwd
    \item
      The file \texttt{..} refers to the parent of your pwd
    \item
      Any time you give a filename to a command you can give a relative or absolute/full path.
      An absolute path always starts from root (so it begins with \texttt{/}).
      A relative path is from the pwd
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Environment Variables}
  Environment Variables are available to every process through the system call \textit{environ}, they are inherited from the parent process through the \textit{exec} system call. You don't really need to know what this means\footnote{Not yet anyways, wait until you take CS351}. What you need to understand is that bash creates some environment variables and they are available to the programs that you run in bash. 

  You can view your environment variables using the command \texttt{env}. Some notable ones are listed below.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      USER - the user currently logged in
    \item
      HOME - the come directory of USER
    \item
      PATH - a list of directories used to search for incomplete filenames(typically programs)
    \item
      PWD  -  your present working directory
    \item
      SHELL - USER's login shell(specified in /etc/passwd)
    \item
      EDITOR - USER's preferred utility to edit files (should always be set to emacs)
    \item
      PS1   -  can be used to customize your command prompt
  \end{itemize}

  In bash you can use an environment variable by prefixing its name with a `\$'.

\begin{verbatim}
$ echo $USER
foo
\end{verbatim}

  You can set an environment variable using the bash built-in command \texttt{export}. 

\begin{verbatim}
$ export PS1="what should I do now? "
\end{verbatim}  
  

  \subsection{Arguments and IO redirection} 
  Where do the commands that we have been using come from? In fact, they are just normal programs
  most of the are written in C and they are not part of bash\footnote{There are some built-in commands in bash; cd is one example. See the SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS section of the bash manpage }.
